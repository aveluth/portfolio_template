# Personal Website Template

This repository contains a template for a personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Ideal for researchers or students who want to show case their work. It includes multiple pages such as home, publications, and resume, along with styling for a responsive design. This is a very minimalistic design created by [a non-expert](https://aveluth.de/). 

## Set-up

To use this website template, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/aveluth/portfolio_template.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Repository**: Move into the cloned repository directory:
   ```
   cd portfolio_template
   ```

3. **Modify Content**: Replace the existing content (images, text, etc.) with your own personal information and content.

4. **Customize Styling**: Modify the CSS files in the `styles` directory to customize the styling according to your preferences.

## Deployment

Once you have customized the website according to your requirements, you can deploy it using Surge.sh. Here's how:

1. **Install Surge**: If you haven't already installed Surge, you can do so using npm (Node.js package manager):
   ```
   npm install -g surge
   ```

2. **Build the Website**: Before deploying, make sure to build the website to ensure all changes are applied:
   ```
   surge
   ```

   This command will guide you through the process of creating an account (if you don't have one already) and deploying the website.

3. **Access Your Website**: Once the deployment process is complete, Surge will provide you with a URL where your website is hosted. You can access your website using this URL.
